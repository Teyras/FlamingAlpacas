# Flaming Alpacas

Flaming Alpacas is a 2D shooter game with a cooperative network multiplayer.

## How to play

When you start Flaming Alpacas, you will be prompted for some basic options for the game:

### Hosting a game

Being a host means that your computer cares about keeping track of the state of the game
and other players send their requests to it. Every game needs exactly one host. To host a
game, check the "Host the game" checkbox and fill in the port (probably 1000-9999) you want
your computer to listen on.

### Joining a game

If someone else hosts the game, fill in his IP address and his server port to join his game.

### The board

In Flaming Alpacas, you control a blue alpaca that fights side by side with its green
comrades against the endless hordes of red trees that try to pass the board from the left
side to the right side. If that happens, it means game over.

The board contains dark grey blocks which no alpaca or tree can pass or shoot through.
These can be used to your strategic advance.

### Controls

You can move your alpaca with `WASD` and shoot with `Spacebar`. Alpacas can only shoot
from left to right.
